        The app should be open source and transparent for any aspect of it. It should be able to run on a free tier of
        monitoring and notifications. For begining I will start to log all my efforts and expenses in the project. It
        should provide a good overview of the project and the costs of running it for any potential users and
        contributors.

        I have started the project on 19th of March, 2024. I have spent 20 hours on the project so far. I have created
        basic layout, added routing and created auth page. I have also added notifications and modals providers, created
        auth context and created first version of the app routes.
