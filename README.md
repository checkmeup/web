# Web Interface for checkmeup.net

This project provides a simple web interface for the checkmeup.net application, following Feature Sliced Design (FSD) principles.

## Feature Sliced Design (FSD)

Feature Sliced Design (FSD) is an architectural methodology for frontend projects. It divides the application into layers and slices to enhance scalability, maintainability, and reusability. Key principles include:

1. **Layered Architecture**: Separating the application into layers: app, pages, widgets, features, entities and shared.
2. **Sliced Structure**: Dividing the application layers into slices to improve organization and maintainability.
3. **Isolation and Encapsulation**: Ensuring each slice and layer is isolated and encapsulated to reduce dependencies and improve modularity.
4. **Explicit Dependencies**: Making dependencies between layers and slices explicit to improve clarity and maintainability.

For more information about FSD, visit [Feature Sliced Design](https://www.feature-sliced.design/).

Each folder in the `src` directory represents a separate layer of the application and contains a `README.md` file with more information about the layer.
