        This is a simple begining of a Mantine app. It is built with Mantine, React, and Vite. It also includes a simple
        routing setup with React Router. As I noted in the blog post on my personal site, I have a bit of the free time
        on my hands. So I decided to build the application to cron job monitoring. I hope you find it useful. It should
        be a fun project. I will try to keep it simple and transparent.{' '}
