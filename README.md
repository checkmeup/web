# Web Interface for checkmeup.net

This project aims to provide a simple web interface for the checkmeup.net application, following the principles of Feature Sliced Design (FSD).

## Feature Sliced Design (FSD)

Feature Sliced Design (FSD) is an architectural methodology for frontend projects. It focuses on dividing the application into distinct layers and slices to improve scalability, maintainability, and reusability. The main principles include:

1. **Layered Architecture**: Separating the application into layers such as app, processes, pages, features, entities, shared, etc.
2. **Sliced Structure**: Dividing the application into slices based on business domains or features.
3. **Isolation and Encapsulation**: Ensuring that each slice and layer is isolated and encapsulated to reduce dependencies and improve modularity.
4. **Explicit Dependencies**: Making dependencies between slices and layers explicit to improve clarity and maintainability.
